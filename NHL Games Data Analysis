Coded in R using the NHLgames.csv and team_info.csv
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)


Importing the NHL game data:

game_csv <- read_csv("~/Downloads/game.csv.zip")
#View(game_csv)


Importing team name data:

team_info <- read_csv("~/Downloads/team_info.csv")
#View(team_info)


Renaming some variables: 

names(game_csv)[names(game_csv) == "away_team_id"] <- "team_id"
#names(game_csv)[names(game_csv) == "home_team_id"] <- "team_id"


games_csv1 <- inner_join(game_csv, team_info, by = "team_id")

names(games_csv1)[names(games_csv1) == "home_team_id"] <- "team_id"
games_csv1 <- games_csv1[-5]

games_csv2 <- inner_join(games_csv1, team_info, by = "team_id")


Now to clean up the data!

NHLgames <- games_csv2[-c(5, 15, 19, 20, 24)]
NHLgames <- NHLgames[-10]

names(NHLgames)

names(NHLgames)[names(NHLgames) == "shortName.x"] <- "Away_City"
names(NHLgames)[names(NHLgames) == "teamName.x"] <- "Away_Team"
names(NHLgames)[names(NHLgames) == "abbreviation.x"] <- "Away_Code"
names(NHLgames)[names(NHLgames) == "shortName.y"] <- "Home_City"
names(NHLgames)[names(NHLgames) == "teamName.y"] <- "Home_Team"
names(NHLgames)[names(NHLgames) == "abbreviation.y"] <- "Home_Code"

names(NHLgames)

Sort by date!

NHLgames <- NHLgames[order(as.Date(NHLgames$date_time)),]

str(NHLgames)

Now our data is ready to go!

head(NHLgames)

I want to extract the month of each date first:

month <- month(NHLgames$date_time)
year <- year(NHLgames$date_time)
NHLgames <- cbind(NHLgames, month, year)

Adding variable for total goals and point differential
NHLgames$total_goals <- NHLgames$away_goals + NHLgames$home_goals
NHLgames$point_diff <- NHLgames$home_goals - NHLgames$away_goals


I will even filter to only look at my favorite team, the Anaheim Ducks:

NHLDucks <- NHLgames %>% filter(Away_Team == "Ducks" | Home_Team == "Ducks")













Exporting the data in case I decide to work on it again:

write_csv(NHLgames, file = "NHLgames.csv")
